# 🎭 Overture

A digital card game where players act as theater ushers, seating patrons to maximize victory points and manage theater chaos.

## 🚀 Play the Game

```bash
# Run the development server
deno task dev

# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

## 🧰 Available Tasks

All tasks are defined in `deno.json` and run via `deno task <name>`:

| Task | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `dev` | `deno run -A npm:vite@5` | Start the Vite dev server with HMR |
| `build` | `deno run -A npm:vite@5 build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `preview` | `deno run -A npm:vite@5 preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `check` | `deno check --doc src/**/*.js` | Type-check JS files (validates JSDoc code blocks too) |
| `lint` | `deno lint src/` | Lint source files with Deno's built-in linter |
| `test` | `deno test src/` | Run all unit tests |
| `ci` | `check → lint → test` | Run the full CI pipeline sequentially |

### Running CI Locally

```bash
# Run all checks in one command (type-check → lint → test)
deno task ci

# Or run individually
deno task check
deno task lint
deno task test
```

## 📋 How to Play

1. **Start** — Click "Start Game" on the title screen
2. **Select** — Click a card from your hand (bottom of screen)
3. **Place** — Click an empty seat in the theater grid to place that patron
4. **Score** — The game ends when the deck runs out (scoring is simplified in this version)

### The Goal
Seat patrons strategically to earn victory points. Different patron types have special placement rules and synergies!

### Primary Patrons
| Type | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| **Standard** | Worth 3 VP anywhere. |
| **VIP** | 5 VP base; +3 VP in front rows. Penalty near Kids and Noisy patrons. |
| **Lovebirds** | 0 VP base; +3 VP if adjacent to another Lovebird. **×2 VP** in back rows. |
| **Kid** | 0 VP base; 2 VP only if capped by Teachers on both ends of a group. |
| **Teacher** | 1 VP base; +1 VP for each adjacent capped Kid. |
| **Critic** | 2 VP base; **×3 VP** if seated in an aisle seat. |

### Secondary Traits
Traits can be applied to any patron type, adding unique bonuses or penalties.

| Trait | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Bespectacled** | +2 VP in front 3 rows (closer to the stage). |
| **Tall** | Patron directly behind this seat gets −2 VP. |
| **Short** | +2 VP if no one is in front; −3 VP if a **Tall** patron is in front. |
| **Noisy** | Each adjacent patron (any type) gets −1 VP. |


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: [Deno](https://deno.land/) — Modern JavaScript runtime with built-in TypeScript support
- **Bundler**: [Vite 5](https://vitejs.dev/) — Fast HMR and builds
- **Language**: JavaScript with JSDoc — Type-safe JS without compilation
- **Engine**: [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) — Popular 2D game framework

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses **Deno's built-in test runner** — no extra test framework needed.

```bash
deno task test
```

**Coverage**: 93.5% branch / 99.2% line across `scoring.js` and `types.js` (39 tests).

Tests live alongside source files (`src/scoring.test.js`) and cover:

- All 6 patron types and 4 traits scoring rules (Standard, VIP, Lovebirds, Kid/Teacher capping, Critic; plus Tall, Short, Bespectacled, and Noisy modifiers)
- Edge cases: empty grids, unknown types, overlapping debuffs, back-row multipliers
- Deck creation: correct card count, patron distribution, and metadata

The scoring engine (`src/scoring.js`) is intentionally kept as **pure functions with no Phaser dependency**, making it straightforward to test in isolation.

## 📝 Notes

- **No audio** — Sound effects not yet added
- **JSDoc types** — All type annotations via JSDoc; `deno task check` validates them including code blocks in doc comments

## 🚧 Roadmap

### Next Up
- [ ] **Play Variants** — Different "plays" with special rules
- [ ] **Audio** — Ambient theater sounds and placement effects

## 📚 Learning Phaser?

This codebase includes extensive JSDoc comments explaining Phaser concepts:

- **Scenes** — `src/scenes/TitleScene.js`, `src/scenes/GameScene.js`
- **Game Objects** — `src/objects/Card.js`
- **Configuration** — `src/main.js`

Check the code comments for explanations of:
- Scene lifecycle (init, preload, create, update)
- Interactive objects and events
- Containers for grouping elements
- Tweens for animations
- Grid-based game object placement
